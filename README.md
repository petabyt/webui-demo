This template is the holy grail of all webview-based UI solutions. Powered by [webui](https://github.com/webui-dev/webui).

- Portable
- Compiles instantly
- 1mb x86_64 static binary (compared to 77mb Tauri AppImage)
- No need to deal with .debs or rpms
- Uses a modern browser - you aren't at the mercy of WebKitGTK or MS WebView
- Serve static or dynamically allocated files
- Lower RAM usage than WebView or Tauri (finds a browser that is already running)
